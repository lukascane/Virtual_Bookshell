# Feature list/Wishlist

## What problem are you solving with this app

- Problem: I don`t know a book to a topic.
- If we google for books, we get ads and not the entire possibilities
- And I can`t store in a good/user friendly way

## What can the user do with it?

- We offer a catalogue of books (using API)
  - To search for books based on a keyword (e.g. bread - would get cooking books for bread)
  
- We offer the possibilities to create a list to read books (books to read)
- To list books that are already read
- To give a small review and evaluation of a book (like 5 of 10 books)
- The reviews are attached to the books itself
- Create a profile
- Have a personal database and manage that (CRUD)
- Have a demo mode/fake account to show the whole functionality without sign up
- Note for Search bar if there is not title (inside of Search bar component) 
- To suggest books to friends/ a friend with a button -> send a mail
- Share button for social media
- Where are the books available online/online shop

## Create MVP (minimal viable product) feature list project road map (what we want to achieve by the end of the 7 weeks if everything goes as planned)
